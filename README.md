## Overview

This project is a Real Estate Listing Tracker that scrapes property data from [MyHome.ge](https://www.myhome.ge/), processes and stores the data, and generates visual analytics presented in a web dashboard. It enables ongoing monitoring of real estate trends and prices across different cities and streets in Georgia.

## Features

* **Web scraping**: Data extraction from real estate websites
* **Data cleaning**: Structured formatting and transformation of raw data
* **Database storage**: Uses SQLite to store cleaned data
* **Data analysis**: Generates a variety of charts for insights
* **Web dashboard**: Interactive HTML interface to view visual analytics

## Pipeline

The main data pipeline runs as follows:

```
Step 1: Scrape the data and save it to a csv file

Step 2: Data cleaning and transformation. Saved cleaned data in a seperate csv file

Step 3: Save cleaned data in the database

Step 4: Extract all the data from the database and do data analysis

Step 5: An interactive website to view visual analytics
```

Each step is modular, allowing individual components to be run or debugged separately.

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Selenium** for web scraping
* **Pandas** for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
* **SQLite** as the database
* **HTML/CSS/JS** for the dashboard

## Dashboard

The dashboard (`frontend/index.html`) provides:

* City distribution pie chart
* Average price per city by listing type

Charts are dynamically displayed using JavaScript and loaded from pre-generated `.png` files.
